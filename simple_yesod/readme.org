* Simple ( Single-File yesod examples ) to get a feel for yesod
** Running
To run one of these files, the easiest way is with runhaskell:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
runhaskell helloworld.0.hs
#+END_SRC 

** Inspected generated code:
It is very useful ( well it was to me anyhow ) to see the code that the yesod
meta programming generates as knowing what goes on under the hood makes it
easier to understand the type errors. 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ghc -ddump-splices helloworld.0.hs
#+END_SRC
