* BFPG Talk on Yesod 
This is the working ground for a talk I am preparing for [[http://www.bfpg.org/][BFPG]] in june. Watch this space!

** Simple Yesod
Take a look in the simple_yesod folder for some super simple one-file yesod
applications that help demystify the basics of yesod without needing to jump
into the scaffolding. 

** Presentation.{org,txt}
These are my rough outline of what I want to talk about. They aren't really fit for 
human consumption yet and will be refined / replaced with a real outline and slides
later on.
